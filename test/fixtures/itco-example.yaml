      description: >-
        APT37 is a suspected North Korean cyber espionage group that has been
        active since at least 2012. The group has targeted victims primarily in
        South Korea, but also in Japan, Vietnam, Russia, Nepal, China, India,
        Romania, Kuwait, and other parts of the Middle East. APT37 has also been
        linked to following campaigns between 2016-2018: Operation Daybreak,
        Operation Erebus, Golden Time, Evil New Year, Are you Happy?, FreeMilk,
        Northern Korean Human Rights, and Evil New Year 2018.

        North Korean group definitions are known to have significant overlap,
        and the name Lazarus Group is known to encompass a broad range of
        activity. Some organizations use the name Lazarus Group to refer to any
        activity attributed to North Korea. Some organizations track North
        Korean clusters or groups such as Bluenoroff, APT37, and APT38
        separately, while other organizations may track some activity associated
        with those group names by the name Lazarus Group.
